            <h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>

            <p>We respect your privacy. Ultimate Video Translator doesn’t track you or transfer your data to third parties.</p>

            <h3 id="what-information-do-we-collect">What information do we collect</h3>

            <p>We only collect telemetry data for better user experience.</p>

            <p>Telemetry data is anonymous data that shows us which buttons are clicked, which features are used, and by how many people. Again, no PII (personally-identifiable information) is collected. This only helps us understand the overall user behavior and is vital in product design.</p>

            <p>Currently, telemetry data includes the following components:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>a unique random id, for counting the number of users</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>your language preference and the country you located in, for improving localization</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>your operating system type and browser type, for improving performance on different platform</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>the name and version of current extension, for statistics</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We use Google Analytics to help us collect and manage the data, but what is collected is completely controlled by us, which means you won’t be bothered by Google Ads.</p>

            <h3 id="browser-permissions-to-all-pages">Browser permissions to all pages</h3>

            <p>You may find it suspicious that our extension request permission to access all visited web pages. It’s the permission that enables us to inject translation scripts to all pages. Those scripts help you translate full websites, videos on sites and translate it with a simple shortcut, or by double-clicking.</p>
